I would request all the user to kindly be careful when you are buying the product. Amazon very smartly mention at only one place that you can get only replacement and not refund.So the user has not other option left just to get the product replace.Conclusion for me.I can only pray that the product work atleast for 1 year and the replace product doesn't have the technical issue and i dont have to run behind the service center.I will definitely AVOID buying products from Amazon.

Camera performance is average. Processor SD 625 is aged not the latest (but still good). Battery life is sufficient. SIM ejector pin is too small may get lost (careful!). Has got a notification LED on bottom. Has most of the decent sensors (Compass, Step, Gyro etc.). Has IR Blaster.The phone looks identical to other Redmi phones. The display is the main attraction.Overall performance is average, don't expect huge from this phone at this price segment. Good for average user.\n", '\nVery nice phone for average users, very good battery backup,no lagging or hanging, good screen, size also handy.Camera is disappointing, not good for camera lovers.

This phone is a mess. I am not sure why Xiaomi is not fixing the issues on this phone. I wasted my money on this. This has got horrible cons like:1. this phone will never show you notificaiton icon at status bar. So basically, you will get a sound or vibration that something app has got a notification but you cant see at the phone screen top status bar which is something a 3rd class phone also shows. So this means you will have either have to slide down the top of screen to check the hidden status bar or foolishly keep sliding and check which App has a notification. Worst experience.2. Screen is sluggish  to navigate, slow one.3. Sound out put is not that good.4. Camera is average.5.MIUI being 9.6 is very disaapointing and not user friendly. I was using redmi note 5 pro and it was far better.  I bought this one just because of smaller size to easily fit into pocket. i am regretting now.Verdict: Better go for redmi note 5 pro and avoid this one atleast.\n', '\nI just bought it 14 days back....

I said it was purchased from Amazon and you can verify in your computer. Immediately, she refused and demanded the soft copy. I said there is net problem in the handset and I cannot get immediately. Then she has shown me a number written on the wall and advised me to talk to them. In spite of my repeated requests also she has not attended my phone.I told her, madam it was purchased just 15 to 20 days back it is a brand new piece. It is having full warranty. Then also she just doesn‚Äôt care and said as per my company instructions without invoice copy I cannot attend.Immediately, after coming out from that service center, I have purchased a new mobile of Nokia Company.It is my blunder mistake in choosing MI product.

Comparing the discharge rate with my usage this discharges quick(even aft disabling face unlock).4.Sometimes I don\'t get my downloaded photos and videos in gallery/file managerPROS1. Rear camera is decent and less noises due to high quality sensors2. This is one of the few phone which has less screen size with notch display(this is for those who like small screens)3.

If I click on any link, it takes through MI browser instead of chrome and I did not see option to select chrome as default browser it's a big pain. Very very difficult to uninstall MI apps by general public, he should have knowledge on how software works in order to uninstall.2. Max volume & Brightness is less when compared to other mobiles.3. Display clarity is little low even when compared with Lenevo K6 Power.4. New work reception & net speed is 20% less.5. Lot of times finger unlock is not working.6. Bluetooth signal breaks if mobile placed in back picked it has become a pain while Jogging and cycling.7.

Let's see.Pros:-1. Full HD+ Resolution no one is providing at this price point (one of the most deciding factors for me)2.

The cameras. AVERAGE but good for occasional photography3. The processor damn how many 625 did Xiaomi actually bought? It's fine for me tho I don't game much but when I do there's barely any lag and I choose 625 because I wanted the most juice with the massive 4000mAh battery so yeah good for me but not for others.4.

Once I reach service center they say 2599 for glass then18% GST and (till that you can understand) but they also ask for 413 rs for replacement charges. I mean for warranty piece at least you can expect that they take screen cost only.

It‚Äôs still more of the same thing.\n', "\nNow using the Redmi 6 Pro for a month, here's my honest feedback.1. Battery life - This is something worth mentioning. Battery life is excellent in Redmi 6 Pro. It almost gives me around 1.5 days of juice in low use and 1 day approx in high usage. The lowest life I did record was around 18 hours. P.S. my phone is always connected to a 4G network with data on.2. Display: Colours are vibrant and viewing angles are decent. The 18:9 notch screen is vivid and FHD videos are a joy to watch. Tried to play a 4K content which was downscaled yet the quality was excellent. Only small issue is the display has an off-white-ish tint which id a bit let down.3. Dual SIM+ Dedicated MicroSD slot - Unlike the hybrid slot, this device boasts a triple slot, a rare sight in high-end devices. This allows me to use 2 SIMs as well as a MicroSD at one time. Used a 128GB SanDisk card to test and it worked flawlessly.4. RAM management - I tried multiple apps in one time to test the tenacity of the device. With 1.7GB approx free of 3GB in standard use, multiple apps use showed 1.1GB free. Even then the apps were working fine, very less lag and smooth user experience.5. Camera - With dual camera at rear, the photos were good if not best. But low light performance is poor. Too much noise and camera app needs basic enhancement (which I expect in MIUI10 update coming soon). The front camera is no deal breaker yet takes decent snaps in proper light condition and not so good in low light. However portrait mode works excellent and the bokeh is good in both rear & front camera.6. Sound - speaker is mono yet loud. Sound is not jarring and maintain a balance. Loudspeaker on call is decent.7. Face unlock - this new feature only works excellent if in proper light condition. This face unlock doesn't work in low/no light condition.8. VoLTE - HD calls are excellent. No problem at all.9. Connectivity - Wi-Fi & Mobile data both have excellent performance.I recommend this device highly. Expecting better camera performance in later updates.\n", '\nActually i am very happy with this redmi 6 pro i purchased it for 6500‚Çπ  4gb ram 64 gb model in exchange offer by exchanging my redmi 3s prime mobile all is good battery,design,build quality. but camera is the not good its average for this 12000‚Çπ(4gb ram 64gb IM) is more costly its better to drop price ,and thanku for amazon fast delivery and for good offer\n', "\nI bought Black Redmi 6 Pro (4GB RAM, 64GB) on Sunday, 29th Oct.

When I tried again, it said - Gmail Keeps Stopping. I went online to MI and chatted with the support. They asked me to Fast Reboot. I had already deleted data/cache. But nothing happened. I was asked to uninstall updates, later even for Google Play Service, I tried all these 2-3 times, but the bug persisted. Then, a factory reset and still...no solution. Eventually, I had to make a trip to the service center with the brand new Redmi 6 Pro.They kept the phone for 3-4 hours. It was diagnosed as a software issue. And...they couldn't resolve it. Finally, they gave up and gave it to me in writing - the hardware needs to be replaced. So I contacted Amazon on Tuesday evening, who were quick to engage and issue me a replacement.Today, I receive the replacement. I opened the brand new phone. Tried Gmail. And - still the same problem! I spoke with MI agent, who said, to ask Amazon to replace and if this happens for the 3rd time, then take a refund.What's baffling is that a brand new phone, released recently, has such an issue. And - no one knows what's going on. I wonder if the seller has all faulty ones; maybe it's with the black color. And service from MI won't help much.Not sure if others have experienced the (Gmail) bug. And you can't be sure unless you open the box and try your brand new phone.

The front camera is extremely poor and has been downgraded and doesn't produce even a decent quality picture. Selfie lovers, please don't even buy this phone you will get a heart ache after looking at your pix. The rear camera picture quality is average and is very unlike of xiaomi.On the other side, the basic things like the output from the speaker phone and and the earphone are extremely poor and distorted...The only con is a decent screen, however that is contributed by low quality video while played in amazon or netflix..Had complained to Amazon on the above low quality issues, unfortunately Amazon is not willing to listen, they are saying technically the phone is working and hence it can't taken back.. Unfortunately, in this case Amazon has put its sellers over it buyers who are their bread and butter.  Hope Amazon listens to my complaint here and takes measures to improve their service... Just to put things into perspective, an average 6-7k phone is sold at an extremely abnoxiously at a high price of 11k. You can find many better phone at this high price.

Out of 4 GB RAM only 2.1 GB available without any new app installation/opening. Display size mentioned is 5.84 inch but display width is 5 mm less compared to other Redmi Note  5.5inch display phone. No dedicated Menu-Navigation button on hard case but optional soft button appears on screen, after this the effective screen size is LESS in all respective compared to all 5.5 inch phone. But over all physical lower width gives a BETTER grip on hand. The SIM tray having two Nano SIM plus dedicated SD slot together is very very delicate to handle. Notification light is on bottom left corner so in little darkness phone is always picked up in upside down manner if notification light is glowing. Top notification bar is really very very tiny. Data /Wifi connection speed, Mobile network name, alarm clock active or not etc can only be seen after pulling down the top menu bar but not in standard on screen display. Overall the front camera wrap around display is nothing but projecting calculated bigger display when it is practically less. Somehow in WhatsApp voice call screen does not wake up and I could not sort it out anyway. Speaker volume found be lower compared to my other 2 Redmi phones. Speaker position is on bottom edge not on the backside thus keeping phone on a surface does not affect loudspeaker quality. Signal strength Ok, Sound quality OK.\n', '\nI am a redmi 3s user.

Picture quality, front and back camera are very good. Battery life is also very good. With data on full day and extensive use of net for 9 hours, the battery ‚ÑÖ falls from 100% to 75%. I am highly satisfied with this product except sound quality. I listen bluetooth speaker but the Equaliser does not work at bluetooth mode. This problem is common to all MI mobiles.\n', '\nMi phones have a lot of advertisements now, that are everywhere on all the useless extra software they install (it helps them make a little bit of money )Takes quite some time to follow a thorough internet guide to sit and uninstall all the bloatware apps one by one and then denying them permissions to flash advertisements individually. In fact It makes you wait 10 seconds per app to revoke permissions for collecting your data and then flashing adverts.Since this is a known issue.. whoever buys it should be tech savvy enough to go about turning such stuff off or take the help of a tech savvy friend to do the same.Once the phone is setup by a tech savvy person.. its hardware software combo is shockingly good for the price. It just works.. and efficiently.. Much more than a day of mixed usage.Even if you do not remove all the adverts that keep flashing.. the battery life is good, but then the adverts are ANNOYING. Even the System Cleaner software advertises tons of flashing junk Adverts after its done cleaning!But it for the battery life, And severely good hardiness which is better than the basic 6 because it is thicker to house the larger battery and fairs very well in all the strange drop test videos i saw on the internet before deciding to purchase this model.The MIUI interface is super smooth as usual, this is my 4th MI phone purchased and I also use a their TV and the incredible wifi router (which again has unbelievable software based options only available by brands selling at 5 times higher cost). So yes, this being the 6th Mi product i bought since 2014, I trust the quality.Only issue is you really have to get all tech savvy to get rid of the advertisements. I wish MI stops doing this new trend, there are too many adds. the Finger Print sensor  and face unlock, both work well and even though earlier I had ignored using them before, its a much happier faster experience to use it. However it is not as fast as the flagship models. But not a deal breaker.All in all i would like to say.. The first Redmi 1s i had bought in 2014, still looks brand new and works (but battery life went down and MI does not sell battery for that model after 5 years now) Based on that I expect this one will last 3 to 5 years aswell if treated right.\n', "\nThis mobile can't work dual 4g volt stand by mode. It is very big disadvantage, now all mobile coming on dual volte your also try realme , asus\n", '\nReally worth for the priceThe most attracting is its battery life upto 1 and half day with average use..display quality is also a plus point..after mi ui update camera also get improved and feels good .sound quality feels like dolby .totally redmi has completely changed its platform by this one . some demerits also am mentioning take little bit more time to charge than i expect. Can only use one 4g provider at a time. Portrait mode is little disappointing..low light also..dedicated sim slot is a plus point so dont bother about 32 gb. And snapdragon 625 is performing good with 3gb ram.. Overall pretty good in look with notch (1st in mi series).Comparing with the competator nokia 5.1 plus 6 pro is so far better and the most worth phone by its price (11k)\n', "\nYes the title sums it all. This is the worst mobile from Xaomi stable .I have been a Xaomi fan and it has been my 2nd phone always used for games, gps and other activities which I dont want my main phone to drain with.Earlier used Mi Phone, Redmi 4 and then Redmi Note 5 pro. All the above have passed with flying colors in terms of battery , not hanging and even camera (Which I rarely use on my secondary phone.) Redmi Note 5 pro is still the best from the stable with Performance, Battery and superb camera.Since I bought Redmi 6 pro, I have problems.a. Maps don't work as it crashes each time I start using direction.b. Battery is not great , even with limited uses max it stays for 36 hours.c. Apps crashing. Many of the apps keep crashing specifically after the update to MIUI 10d. The touch of the phone is not great as going back and front sometimes can be tough , need to double touch couple of times.So avoid buying this phone, instead buy the redmi note 5 pro.But I guess every company will have one bad product so I feel for Xaomi this is that one product. The faster they scrape manufacturing of this it is better. Don't ruin the image just because of this phone.This review is after nearly 5 months of extensive usage.\n", '\nAmazon and Mi. How did you guys allow a faulty phone get into the market and then put it under replacement warranty for only "7 days"??!! Its ridiculous. The phone started hanging within one and half months, with the constant need for reboot. After trying everything (soft reset, hard reset, factory reset, repair service centre) it still having the same problem. Was this some horrible plan to ensure your customers start hating the brand. I am not a heavy data or app user. And it still reboots! The time that it worked, there was still a lag but manageable. But after the freezing screen and inability of service center to fix it, Mi- you have disappointed me. Amazon you should relook at the time the phone should be allowed an exchange.\n', '\nGot 3gb version at 8999. I am writing this review after 10 days use. It appeared to be bit big screen before buying, however after actually holding it in hand feels easy to operate. Bit heavier due to large battery capacity. The display, battery and camera are definitely above average. Touch feedback is awesome. Plus it has very useful IR blaster. 9nly down side is quick charge function. However with so many other plus points, this is best buy under 10k category\n', "\nFor a net price of 6.3k, it's a good deal for me. However, 11k is definitely an overprice for this product. I'll share a brief review of this phone.PROs:-1. Display is bright and vivid. Sound is pretty loud. Excellent.2. Phone is lightweight. Definitely feels small for a 5.84 inch screen, thanks to 19:9 aspect ratio. Metal back is good too. Design Excellent.Tip: Go for red, looks very attractive and premium.3. Primary camera is great in the price bracket. Front camera not so. Decent.4. Battery life is long. Lag free experience. Very Good.Now, for the cons:-1. Software and apps not completely optimised for the notch. Will find bugs here. Ok.2. No dual volte support i.e., no 4G on both sims together. Gorilla Glass lacking. Poor.3. Not for selfie lovers. Front camera is nowhere near Note 5 Pro.Conclusion: It doesn't stand out, as such, in any particular aspect but does give a good combination of low and mid range fetaures. For average users- go for 3GB variant as it offers value for money. 4GB variant is absurdly priced given the camera quality and chipset (SD 625). Thumbs up will help.\n", '\nHeelo guys I am writing this review in behalf of this phone I have used this for 1 week and this phone have gave me many new specifications if sound quality is better than any other phone but its camera is not that good but suitable for this price range this phone is compatible for any user it gives the person a good experience of smartphone its screen is made of gorilla glass and it gives the user a good style and design experience it gives the user a relastic gaming experience when games like pubg, asphalt 8, fortnite is played in this phone its sound quality is better but not best it is value for money ots gives you a cool look!

Mostly opens on first try - may to do with phone being busy or free perhaps?Too much MI apps intrusion though - google is world leader (other than I-phone) - I would just let the customer rely on and leverage google (the choice is there but MI keeps asking for permissions - ultimately for peace of mind you tend to relent)\n", "\nphone is good as I am a hardcore Mi fan.all the features.but I notice phone getting heated while i was transferring data from my mi note 4 to mi 6 pro with mi mover, that's bad.face unlock works fine in proper lighting areas.red color is to much bright for me as a working men but i selected it because i was bored with siver and black, so will keep this time red.over all 3.5 out of 5.\n", "\nBad bad bad....

Requires mobile phone case / protector because rear camera is aligned with body and hence if kept on table / other surface, the lens would get scratches and thus making the camera unusable.3. There are multiple Mi apps that are installed by default by the manufacturer and runs in background (probably would be collecting and sharing personal data) which cannot be stopped or uninstalled.\n', "\nI liked the design of the phone it looks and the touchscreen is too good.Rear camera is good and front camera is ok.The mi features also too good to use.i checked everything what I required and it's perfectly alright...

I am so impressed that in future I am considering to buy only from MI. It includes somany features which are useful on day to day usage like IR, call recorder etc. Surprised to see you get all those at this price range unlike samsung whose most features are only available in top end variants while not so useful either.

I used note 4 and I was highly satisfied with that where as this one with poor back and front camera slowest CPU which hangs during making video as well as taking pics, not good for gaming. The notch is poorly designed as icons can be seen inside the notch getting hidden as it was a infinity display forcefully given a notch. The only great this is playing video HD and battery else all outdated\n', "\nMy handset is very third class. It's fingerprint sesor, face recognition works only after 10 to 12 tries. Biggest prolem is it's screen does'nt appear when i try to unlock it by ay of the option whether it be face, finger or pin. Power button also does'nt glare up the screen. I jeed to restart it again and again. This is my 4th MI phone. I will not buy MI anymore. It's battery does'nt work like previous MI phones. Very disappointed.\n", '\nI bought the phone during the Summer Sale, so I got it for Rs 9,999/-. Though I was really disappointed just after purchasing it the price further dropped to Rs.8,499/-! But it\'s a worthy buy under 10K. Now coming to the phone, the colour I ordered was blue and it is beautiful. The feel of the phone is perfect. Those who don\'t want a "big" phony yet want to flaunt it, it\'s perfect for them. The 5.84 inches FHD+ display is fluid and vibrant. The 625 Snapdragon chipset is a reliable processor for fast multitasking. The cameras are just ok , 5MP in the front and 12MP+5MP rear setup. Although it has AI face recognition, I would suggest you to avoid it as sometimes it may lag under low light conditions. The fingerprint sensor is smooth, unlocks in a giphee. Now the best part of the phone is it\'s battery life, the 4000mAh high capacity battery is surely to deliver a long lasting service. It runs on MIUI OS which is easy to use and people are getting familiar to this nowadays. To sum up, the phone is a competitive contender under the 10K segment of smartphones.\n', '\nPhone worked best during the first 6 months. After that the apps started lagging, and after 1.5 years of usage the device screen goes blank/black every once in a while while using it and the only way to get out of black screen is to turn the phone off.I had placed order for 2 of the same phones. The first phone is working fine while the second which I am reviewing now has been having these problem. The second phone also has network connectivity problem/performance since day one when compared to first phone. It lost network connection at times whe. The first phone worked without any problem on the same networks (Jio, Idea) while the second phone lost connetions at high density areas with same networks. This is a quality defect from manufacturers side which manufacturer is not ready to accept as it will need complete line/batch of products to be recalled and replace the device without charge to customers.\n', '\nFor this price point, it is an amazing deal. Xiaomi really has done it again. Really fast midrange processor , paired with MIUI provides a almost iPhone level of smoothness. Battery life is amazing, with a monster 4000 mAh battery, this phone easily lasts for two days of charge. SOT (Screen on time) is about 7-8 hours of normal usage before the battery drains, meaning I could use this phone for hours and hours. Amazingly, T-Mobile LTE works perfectly on this device, and as well as 3G. Call quality is great, tons of memory, and a great screen makes this phone an amazing deal. There is even an option to "disable" the notch if you really wanted. For gaming performance, this phone is an absolute beast. PUBG Mobile, a very graphics intensive game runs smoothly at medium settings with no frame drops. This phone\'s chip is well cooled, and it won\'t fry your hand when playing intensive games. The snapdragon chip in here absolutely destroys other MediaTek equipped devices, and stomps on the older SD625. Good ROM support and a unlocked bootloader makes it very easy to ROOT and Mod to your liking if that is your thing.All in all, unbeatable value for a phone of this price. Is actually better that most phones twice, or even three times its price.\n', '\nI owned Redmi Note 3 for 2.5 years and it was a great phone. But due to wear and tear and space issues I decided to replace my old phone. Since I got a good buyback price, I bought this without a 2nd thought.1. Battery life is average (about 3/4 day) and I am not a very heavy user. Here we are talking about a brand new battery.2. After the phone is locked it takes a few seconds to respond once I pressed the unlock button.3. Google-maps keeps crashing, and it goes into non-responsive mode every so often.4. Speed is average, and when playing fast games the lag is perceptible as the processor is slower than Note 5.5. Screen size is smaller than other REdmi phones, Y2, Note 5 etc. In terms of the overall dimensions, this phone is about 20% smaller than Note 4 or Note 5.6. The notch display is there, but space is not well utilized in terms of overall design.7. Pictures are poor. Given the camera specs have been touted I was expecting a bit more than normal pictures which other Redmi phones offer.8. As others have mentioned, battery heating is an issue.9. There are too many apps Xoami apps pre-loaded on the phone.If you are reading reviews on Cnet or NDTV beware, because these reviews are paid for and not a fair assessment.With buyback and other discounts, I paid 6300 for this phone. It is not worth more than that.\n', '\n1.

Not support fast charging, but charging speed is also good not so bad at 5 volt 2 amp. We can say its semi fast charging technolodgy and it is good.3.  some featues like full screen gestures are too good, this is miui 10 features but you can get in miui9 in redmi 6 pro.4.bottom speaker is ok not too good as well as bad but the earphone speaker is great,5. Does not supprt dual volte but that was not a big issue i use gio sim for volte so that was not a big issue for me,6. Back camera is good, in front u can get a 5 mg pixel camera but friends you get 4000 ml amp battery and miui so it was great. camera is not a big point for me i preffer features first. but i didnt said camera is bad, its ok7. Built quality is excellent, it feals so stylish in hand8. Processor is 2 years old realeased snapdragon 625 wich not bad in my opinion at this price.( I MEAN ONLY IN 11K PRICE NOT FOR 13 K)9.face unlock is also ggod fingerprint scanner is too goodOk at last i want to say it is very good phone in 11k for those who are looking for a battery and feature of miui. (Not for 13k 64gb Varient it is not value for money).\n', '\nI have purchased this product for my Mom, below is my experience with the phone:1> It is sleek and easy to carry. Looks good appearance wise.2> The battery life is good. For normal usage it goes for 1 day.3> The 4GB RAM supports games of all kind. The graphics are good.4> Camera is one point I was not happy. Also in dim light the picture quality is not good.5> The finger print sensor works well and opens up the phone fast.I would recommend this phone if taking good quality pictures is not on priority list.\n', '\nIts already been many review about this phone so no more to say...ProCamera (for 10000 price range)MiuiBattery (thought it could be better if it received miui 10 update)ConsDisplay (dont waste time for a second.just put glass or tuffen glass for protection)Low light photo graphy is worstFake selfi potrait imageCamera ui is bad (hope receive update soon)Battery back up could be better compare to other 4000 amp battery.it is due to unnecessary app running behind and youbcant uninstall it..Thats it but you cant get anything better than this in 10990 .i got it at 8890.(10%hdfc+1000 rupee amazon pay)I preferred black cause its looks exactly same as i phone 7..,üòÅüòÅHope you enjoy this review and like it\n', '\nHere‚Äôs what you get inside the box:1. Handset2. Charger (5V 2A)3. USB charging cable4. Sim ejector pin5. Translucent CaseDesign:The design of Note 6 Pro same as that of Note 5 Pro so nothing special here. The build quality is decent, and phone feels good in hand. Rating 8/10.Display:The display on the front is a Full HD 6.3-inch notch display with 19:9 aspect ratio. The display is sharp and bright with good viewing angles and colors. It is covered with a 2.5D glass which gives it a premium look. The notch on the top is big and there is a significant chin at the bottom as well. I think Xiaomi could have done a bit better here. Big notches mean less space for notification icons so that‚Äôs not great. Rating 8/10.Battery:The phone comes with a 4000 mAh battery which is also same as Note 5 Pro. So, with moderate usage you can expect a battery backup of 2 days on a single charge. One nice improvement in Note 6 Pro is that Quick Charge 3.0 is available now. The phone does not come with a fast charger though and you need to buy it separately. Rating 10/10.Audio:The speaker at the bottom of the device is surprisingly very loud and clear. The audio via the earphone is average if you don‚Äôt tweak the settings. So, I‚Äôd recommend going into setting and use the equalizer and sound enhancer options to improve audio via 3.5mm jack. Rating 8.5/10.Performance:The Note 6 Pro runs on same Snapdragon 636. Snapdragon 636 is a good midrange chipset with performance and efficiency, so we have no complaints. App opens and close fast. Gaming is smooth as well. If you use a ton of apps then maybe go for the 6GB RAM variant. Rating 8.5/10.Security:Both fingerprint sensor and face unlock work well on the Redmi Note 6 Pro. Fingerprint sensor is quick and accurate while the Face unlock takes a bit of time (less than a second) to unlock the device. Face unlock is not that secure and can unlocked by another person so don‚Äôt use it if you have something on your phone that should not be seen by others. Rating 9/10.Pricing:During Launch, the pricing of Note 6 Pro was a bit of a surprise because Note 5 Pro price was increased from 13999 to 14999 and the Note 6 Pro packs some nice improvements over the 5 Pro so a price increase of 1000 was expected. But instead, Xiaomi launched it at 1000 less i.e. 13999 which was fair enough or good pricing. But as of now when the price dropped for another 2 to 3 bucks, its really a great deal for this phone. Rating: 8/10.Camera:When Redmi Note 5 Pro launched earlier this year, it had one of the best camera in its price range and now Note 6 Pro comes with an improved camera. The aperture and pixel size has improved which means you are going to see a lot of improvement in low light pictures. In earlier tests, the camera performed well and exceeded our expectations.The front camera now gets a secondary sensor for portrait mode pictures. The performance of front camera is good as well. Pictures looks sharp and colorful with good amount of details. The dynamic range wasn‚Äôt great though.The camera is impressive. Few camera samples are included in this review, more samples will be added on the final review on our website. Rating 8.5/10.SummaryOverall, Redmi Note 6 Pro is a well-balanced smartphone at 13999, we think it offers good value for money. If you have a budget of around 15000 and need a phone with good build, good cameras, excellent battery, loud speaker, fast charging then Note 6 Pro should be your choice.If you need a better-looking phone and can compromise with the camera quality and battery backup, then Realme 2 Pro and Honor 8X are good options.If you already have the Note 5 Pro, then you should skip the Note 6 Pro as it is not that big of an upgrade.\n', '\nI preferred this phone for the battery life and for this much of use am getting only 7-8 hours in normal use. Not only about the phone now about the service by amazon,When i lodged complaint more than thrice and what i got the reply from amazon tech support is that to use the phone with power saving mode to extend the battery life, and one of the funniest part is that they told normally a smart phone will get only battery life of 7-10 hours. this is the reply i got when i demand for the replacement or refund. One of the worst experience by amazon ,am not at all satisfied with the service and very bad battery performance so far after software updation, resetting and what ever customer execute told.\n', "\nHiI have brought this phone on THE GREAT INDIAN SALES Oct 11. Order got delivered on 15th October..This is the honest review after one month of usage.I know lot of people are too lazy to read such a long para review and thus for those People I give a three line review..This phone is definitely a best phone only to got it for a price of 10k. Don't go for the 4GB ram varient which is 13k, instead go for redmi note 6 pro which is about 14k to 15k..And the Detailed Review is as follows as*Design*:Design is simply superb.. Phone is cute and this black color is even Sexy*MIUI*:  I am stock android lover and am new to this miui.. At 1st i struggled, later i loved this UI. XIAOMI promised me MIUI 10 but i haven't received yet..*Battery* : Battery ahh nothing to say am astonished this is the 1st time i am charging once a day.. Thnx to the huge 4000mah battery..Charging time : 2 hrs 10 min from 15% to 100%And it last minimum 1 day and maximum 1.5 days ( even 2days depends upon usage)But the charger wire is short, needs special place and arrangements for charging..*Camera* : This is a place where I get disappointed.. Yes camera is average.. Rear camera has good hardware but the portrait shots are below average.. Front camera uses software to create portraits and it is more better than the rear camera.. The camera is the only place where this phone fails to meet expectations..May be XIAOMI can fix it by a update..*Performance* :Yeah XIAOMI uses SD 625 here little disappointed but ok for this price segment.. Using for a month i didn't face any lag, heating issue etc..*Security* :This phone has face unlock and it works well even in slight dark atmosphere and the finger print sensor is Lightning Fast...*Conclusion* :This phone comes with all sensors and IR BLASTER is rocking.. I control everything with this phone... MIUI gives more custom options..I exchanged old phone and got this phone.. I got lot of offers for this phone.Thus 11k phone i got for ‚Çπ5000 appoxAlso I got free screen replacement for one yearBut for othersU can get it for 10k using any bank offer..It's worth every penny even for 10k..But i wont suggest the 4Gb varient which is sold for 13k.. Instead u can go for other optionsThank you ‚ù§\n", "\nPhone is not working properly, when I make a call, the person of others side can't hear me when I got a call then the person can hear\n", "\nEarlier I was worried about which phone to purchase on sale.

Just for the notch, which isn't so great or even in my personal taste, you must not compromise with performance.\n", '\nI had brought this phone under exchange. I liked compactness of the phone. Battery is 1 and 1/2 day coming for me.  Photos are above average.  Bezeles are not less . Screen is better looking when we hide notch. Presently miui with Oreo running. Expecting pie update soon. Phone performs well without lagging. I had not played any games. For normal usage not much heating found.\n', "\nA very good budget phone for emergency or backup use. For this price the quality and feature is very adequate. The camera is good only in daylight but in night it is waste. Xiaomi haven't taken time to customize its UI to make apps appear fully without getting hidden by the notch. Many apps which take full screen are hidden behind the notch. It is just like a poor man's iPhone. Battery life was excellent in first two months but gradually comes down especially if you use lot of GPS and mobile data. I use GPS navigation, 4G mobile data and Bluetooth music streaming and it lasts almost a day only. The charging speed is very slow since it has a big battery and charging rate is the same basic level so it takes a lot of time to get charged. Since it is a LCD screen notch is not adequately hidden in black screen but that is not a complain for a phone at this price. The sound is good speakers output clear sound. The performance is great for this price point. I play Pubg all the time and very rarely did it get hanged maybe like 2 3 times since 3 months. Sometimes the phone lags very bad if the internet is not good while in game. One thing I found this is if you have two Bluetooth devices connected at a time, it can give call permission to only one device. If to both are given then the phone will randomly switch between devices. Overall I found this phone to be a good phone for maybe 1 year use.\n", '\nRedmi 6 Pro is a very nice android device. With 4000 mAH lasts for two days as is claimed and is recharged fast with its charger . It has its own system of checking security including payment securities. Display of 5.84" is good enough. Display resolution of 2280 x 1080 is nice. However, the width should have been more broad for ease of viewing, writing and navigating. It has its good number of useful apps pre-installed that average users may not have to install third party apps like photo editing, notes, cloud storage, scanner, cleaner, compass, torch, etc. Cleaning app regularly checks and suggests cleaning of junk files, memory. Fingerprint lock and AI system is added security. System and security updates are available at regular intervals. The body is strong and solid. With dual rear camera the picture quality is very good even in low light conditions. Networking is good enough depending on the strength of available network providers. Sound quality is nice. The file manager is not convenient. The message management system is also cumbersome. Safety locking from accidental deletion of important messages is lacking. On the whole a nice buy.\n', '\nSuperb. .\n', "\nDisplay quality is top notch, overall the quality of the phone is very good. All metal body. Camera is good too. Touch smoothness is amazing. I will definitely recommend to buy this phone.The USB is not type C, it is the old one. This is the only con that i found till now. It has got 2 nano sim slots and a dedicated memory card slot (2+1).Other than the phone, amazon delivery service is a bit let down. It took 6 days to deliver the item from Calcutta to Assam. Whereas last year i bought 2 Redmi Note 4 ( for me and my uncle) from flipkart and mi india website, if you recall, Mi had flash sale every Friday. Hence i bought both handset on different dates. To my surprise i placed the order on Friday and received the item on Sunday on one occasion and Monday on the other occasion, which the shipped through ekart and FedEx respectively.

It does run on MIUI not on stock android. Thanks to its design it gives a good grip. There is also blue light filter and option to tap the screen to wake up. The phone is responsive and decently fast. The camera performs decently well in its price range. Photos come sharp and crisp. HDR takes good 1-1.5 seconds to capture. But it struggles under low light. It automatically switches to low light mode. The portrait works very good. The selfies are rich and vibrant but it won't work well in harsh backlight though.

Why did I choose this phone?Ans:- My old phone was 2.5 years old. It battery life is getting low. Though i had a power bank i need phone which has bigger display within compact size, better battery backup, nice display, average camera, average processor, bug free user interface.So, How the phone performs?*Design is awesome. Lookwise, the phone is a beauty.* Display is superb. You should have a look @poi which is 434. Even flagship oneplus doesn't have this much pixel density. Not even note5pro,note6pro, & pocophone all have lower ppl than this.Now you can understand the display quality of this phone.* Notch:- This s d first mi phone with notch. Loving it.* Battery:- You get a good battery performance depending upon your usage. It'll give you one full day if you're a heavy user. Moderate usage ll get you 1.5 day. Low usage can deliver2 day battery as Xiaomi claims.* Camera:- Rear camera is good. Front camera is decent. Stay away if you're a camera lover. This s not for u.* Processor:- SD625 eventhogh its old its gold. does the job without lags.multitasking can be done effortlessly. Thats what i do. I don't play much games. From what ive used, i say the performance is good.* Heat generation:-(no one post this as seperate topic...lol) yes. Sometimes its getting hot while charging. But not when you put it to heavy tasking. I think im OK with it.* Fingerprint sensor is OK... But face unlock is bit unreliable...* Touch sensitivity is good though wanting more...Now coming to important topic...MIUI:-Mi is known for quality hardware with flawless software at cheaper pricetag.Nowadays it seems mi has lost that magic touch once Samsung phones believed to have(during early 2010s)...* the specs arent pleasing expect note5(6)pro( i think mi wants to sell note pro series only) other than that none of the mi phones make sense nowadays.Mi says they are making only 5% profit of their hardware sales.

Mi is just fooling customers with this model.2) below average front camera quality, only 5mp.3) again the same boring design of phone.4) notch design makes the phone look ugly, it could be better (but mi hasn't worked seriously on this).5)outdated processor, especially at this price point when others are providing sd 636 at same price(e.g - Asus zenfone max m1 pro)6) display quality is also not that much great whn compared to asus, honor or other devices at 12k price range.7) screen size also looks quite small due to notch on the top.. Its should be 6 inch.Pros of this device -1) good battery, 4000 mah.2) solid metal built quality.3) dual rear cameras is somewhat of good. Quality( but not great at all) .P. S - honestly saying, this is not a worthy phone, better to go. With redmi note 5 pro. At a. Slightly higher price otherwise go for Asus or honor or real me.They are providing much better value for money.Mi seriously needs to work at its strategy after seeing the stiff competition in thd market currently.This phone should be priced at only 8k.\n", "\nI bought 6Pro - Incoming calls not displayed on the screen from day one.  Called MI call center and they asked me to contact Amazon. I called Amazon to replace the order but it was not worked. I won't recommend buying the products. It is waste of money.\n", '\nThe full display, the battery life and the smooth touch because of latest Android and MIUI version makes it a good product. The rear camera is good (cant say great or best) and the front camera is poor. The sound is clear but you can actually feel its a Chinese product. The phone weight is not so heavy and the operation speed is quite good. The only best thing about this phone is unlock by the touch which is super fast. Overall I would recommend to buy if you are not a selfie fetish person and need phone for just calling, chat and web search with a big display and if you dont want to worry about the battery drain. The price INR 10k is fine, it should not be more than that.\n', '\nI brought this phone (Redmi 6 Pro) from amazon and as of now it is 3 months running.The very first impression after purchase was : phone gets heated while charging ... Yes the phone gets a little heated during charging. The impression after 3 months of use is: good phone at this price. I am not a damn crazy user of phone. I use it for daily purpose works, I m sure still there are a few features left over which i have not explored yet. For me so far it is good. Sometimes I face problem with the finger print sensor, it fails to read / detect the registered fingerprint.Over all impression : if you are an average user and want to buy a good phone within 10k range, Redmi 6 pro can be considered (4/5)Suggestion: I have purchased the 32 gb memory one. If you want to click more and more pic/video, then go for the higher memory range one. Because the each pic (clicked in this phone) consumes almost 1 mb, in that sense 32gb quota will finish sooner and phone performance will also get degraded.\n', "\nI bought a product on 18th July, 2019 and got the mobile on 20th July, 2019.

Performed fine until June and suddenly it started cracking up in terms of battery. The phone would go from full charge to zero on 6 hours without any usage. I am unable to figure out how it started to behave like this.

This is the biggest problem that I have faced with this phone.The network reception is just too weak. It keeps fluctuating alot and also it keeps changing between 2g and 4g .Call quality is also not that great, your voice sounds muffled to the other person. The earpiece is also not that loud.3) Performance : RAM Management has not been done well in this phone . Out of 3Gb , I just had 800Mb free out of the box.MIUI has ads. Who puts ads in the UI!?? This is absolutely ridiculous. The UI is not smooth ,it\'s laggy and glitches alot. 4)Rear so called "Dual camera" : The secondary camera is just a gimmick. It\'s just a depth sensor that comes into play when you take portrait shots. Many phones just do the background blurring in portrait shots using AI.Dual camera is just for name sake here.5) Build quality : This phone is not ALL-METAL!I\'ve seen some reviews mentioning that it\'s an all metal body. It is not , It\'s a polycarbonate body.6)Heating issues : Heats up alot when mobile data and location is turned on.FORGET ABOUT PLAYING GAMES ON THIS PHONE.WHEN IT CANT HANDLE BASIC TASKS , PLAYING GAMES IS JUST A DREAM.BASICALLY WHAT IN TRYING TO SAY IS : DONT BUY THIS PHONE. MY HONEST OPINION. I BOUGHT THE PHONE , IM SUFFERING.THERE ARE MANY BETTER OPTIONS OUT THERE.

The 12 MP camera quality is really great and proves that the mega pixels rating is not the only parameter for excellent pictures!5. 4 GB RAM and 64 GB internal memory is more than my need and hence I have not bought a micro SD card!6. The screen - 2280 x 1080 pixel resolution and 432 ppi pixel density 5.84 inch screen is much better than most phones (except the high end ones, which are expensive).7. The phone is not too big to fit into any of my pockets.8. I have not experienced any heating issues, may be because my use is simple and limited. No games!9.

Overall built quality is nice but it is kinda plastici finish, enough loud in speaker and it is also good in headphones. Phone is fast due to processor (even it may be due to brand new product and not that heavily used), overall performance is very nice and impressive, but I felt little heating if used heavily / multitasked but heating is not that major to worry about. Camera quality is decent in the price range; i would say not that impressed but still it fetches decent photographs in bright sunlight,but it struggles in low light. In comparison with RealMe, this phone has lot to improve in camera processing department. But you should not expect too much in this price range. Battery performance is very decent and it will last you whole day, but it is very slow in charging, as for me it took roughly 2:30hrs to charge from zero to 100%. But overall phone is worth buying...\n', '\nThough the phone is using hardware of its predecessor but packed in new display and body is giving it somewhat a closer look of iphone x . One can call it the cheapest replacement of an iphone x with almost similar user interface and unlock and emoji functions. The phone is lag free , good camera pic quality. I am not into gaming but multitasking is also lag free. Good response time. Though i got it as a non prime user so couldnt get the discount as amazon didnt give me one month trial subscription as the payment through debit card was reserved for only kotak and icici bank users, a big turn off and money making policy on behalf of amazon as debit card payment was open for 999 plan from any bank debit card. Overall the product is absolutely fine and also one thing the phone takes around 2.45 hrs to fully charge, bit of a disappointment. Otherwise this budget will meet your demand in many ways.\n', '\nI am using this phone since 14 Feb 19. Feature that I like the most is battery life. 4000 mAH is actually a lot.  Some of the user interfaces are not very friendly. SMS GUI needs thorough revamping. Camera needs improvement both in terms of image stabilisation and brightness adjustments. Photos taken by zooming looses resolution.Overall, it is a very good buy, value for money. Hope it gives trouble free operation for 3 years.\n', '\nThe  MI / Redmi was launched with so much pomp but the phones are really bad, we made a mistake to buy 2 ( 1 online and 1 through the store) but both have had problems with Audio, backup , Starting etc.. within a month of purchase.When you do a new software update it reboots the phone and you loss all your data.The service centre are not very customer friendly, with rude and non-supportive staff ( atleast in Delhi - Kalkaji)\n', '\nWaste mobile. Cared like a child, never dropped or roughly use. But suddenly started giving trouble mainly in network section like calling is not possible. Internet is slow and wifi too. The biggest downgrade the shitty camera. Pictures are taken from this mobile is look like VGA pictures. Seriously I wasted my money on this. I was always looking for PPI, but this time I failed.  Not only me facing network problem I found so many peeps facing the same problem. This is my honest review.\n', "\nAs per the price the phone was good.camera quality is average not pretty great.Battery life is great as usual in MI phones.Fingerprint reader is not upto the notch,it sometimes didn't just let you in and you have to enter password.All is good but the problem is that this started to cause issues in just 1.5 years,,it automatically just switch off without any issue which is quite frustrating.IDK why android phones are not long lasting.All comes with the age limit cap of 2 years i guess so you have to buy again.\n", "\nI've been using this phone for nearly a year now. I've not had a single issue with it so far. It's still as good as it came in the box. It's good looking, compact, sturdy and efficient. It has all the features I need - an HD display, loud sound and an easy user iterface. It has also been updated to Android Pie recently and keeps getting its regular Mi updates.If you're performance-oriented and are looking for a well-balanced, compact device - go for it.\n", "\nAfter this phone, i decided to never purchase any mi or redmi phone.I know, i am writing thie review long time after the purchase. But still it will worth it.The phone is not keeping up with tasks even if it has 3 gb of ram.It should atleast open an an without struggling. It struggles a lot while using multiple app. Even when you restart the phone, it struggles to open an app.It has its own pre-installed apps, which has its advertising content.Camera app is bad.It restricts user to change some type of settings. Like stopping its app's notification & background activity.It is hard to find some user privacy settings.After an os update, you can not even change lockscreen wallpaper. It has its glance wallpaper app built-in.Mobile or WiFi connectivity speed are so low, that even 2g feels fatser sometimes. Worst connectivity.Do not buy such phone.\n", "\nTouch screen is smooth,quality of display is excellent,camera quality is good but not the best, little problem of overheating, speaker volume is low compared to other mi phones.clarity in voice is good Overall a good mobile at this price,Plz don't expect much from a budget phone\n", "\nLike all Redmi devices in recent times with dual cameras, this doesn't disappoint much except I regret the megre 5 MP camera without a flash. This could have been better- at least an 8 MP camera should have been there. The rear cameras are really good, battery life is great and its a great device for those love notches yet dislike large brick size handsets.\n", "\nDisplay quality is top notch, overall the quality of the phone is very good. All metal body. Camera is good too. Touch smoothness is amazing. I will definitely recommend to buy this phone.The USB is not type C, it is the old one. This is the only con that i found till now. It has got 2 nano sim slots and a dedicated memory card slot (2+1).Other than the phone, amazon delivery service is a bit let down. It took 6 days to deliver the item from Calcutta to Assam. Whereas last year i bought 2 Redmi Note 4 ( for me and my uncle) from flipkart and mi india website, if you recall, Mi had flash sale every Friday. Hence i bought both handset on different dates. To my surprise i placed the order on Friday and received the item on Sunday on one occasion and Monday on the other occasion, which the shipped through ekart and FedEx respectively. Merely in 2-3 i got my phone. But Amazon's courier service is a total letdown as compared ekart and FedEx.\n"]
